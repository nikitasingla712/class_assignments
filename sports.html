    Sports are important primarily because they provide children and recreational participants with a social outlet and improve physical skills and health. Sports provide physical and psychological benefits to people of all ages.

Engaging in after-school sporting events gives children the opportunity to be active and get plenty of exercise. In turn, being physically active makes them healthier by improving strength and flexibility. Children who participate in sports are also more likely to maintain a healthy diet and have higher levels of physical and cognitive energy. The benefits of sports participation transcend middle and high school, as children who play sports are thought to be more likely to maintain active lifestyles throughout their lives.
